[Git Source](https://github.com/orbland/orb/blob/cb187170016470708cbd1cff130aa6bcf6c25d76/src/Orb.sol)

**Inherits:**
Ownable, ERC165, ERC721, [IOrb](/src/IOrb.sol/interface.IOrb.md)

**Authors:**

This is a basic Q&A-type Orb. The keeper has the right to submit a text-based question to the creator and
the right to receive a text-based response. The question is limited in length but responses may come in
any length. Questions and answers are hash-committed to the blockchain so that the track record cannot be
changed. The Orb has a cooldown.
The Orb uses Harberger tax and is always on sale. This means that when you purchase the Orb, you must also
set a price which youâ€™re willing to sell the Orb at. However, you must pay an amount based on tax rate to
the Orb contract per year in order to maintain the Orb ownership. This amount is accounted for per second,
and user funds need to be topped up before the foreclosure time to maintain ownership.

*Supports ERC-721 interface but reverts on all transfers. Uses `Ownable`'s `owner()` to identify the
creator of the Orb. Uses `ERC721`'s `ownerOf(tokenId)` to identify the current keeper of the Orb.*


## State Variables
### beneficiary
Beneficiary is another address that receives all Orb proceeds. It is set in the `constructor` as an immutable
value. Beneficiary is not allowed to bid in the auction or purchase the Orb. The intended use case for the
beneficiary is to set it to a revenue splitting contract. Proceeds that go to the beneficiary are:
- The auction winning bid amount;
- Royalties from Orb purchase when not purchased from the Orb creator;
- Full purchase price when purchased from the Orb creator;
- Harberger tax revenue.


```solidity
address public immutable beneficiary;
```


### tokenId
Orb ERC-721 token number. Can be whatever arbitrary number, only one token will ever exist. Made public to
allow easier lookups of Orb keeper.


```solidity
uint256 public immutable tokenId;
```


### FEE_DENOMINATOR
Fee Nominator: basis points (100.00%). Other fees are in relation to this, and formatted as such.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant FEE_DENOMINATOR = 100_00;
```


### KEEPER_TAX_PERIOD
Harberger tax period: for how long the tax rate applies. Value: 1 year.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant KEEPER_TAX_PERIOD = 365 days;
```


### COOLDOWN_MAXIMUM_DURATION
Maximum cooldown duration, to prevent potential underflows. Value: 10 years.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant COOLDOWN_MAXIMUM_DURATION = 3650 days;
```


### MAXIMUM_PRICE
Maximum Orb price, limited to prevent potential overflows.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant MAXIMUM_PRICE = 2 ** 128;
```


### honoredUntil
Honored Until: timestamp until which the Orb Oath is honored for the keeper.


```solidity
uint256 public honoredUntil;
```


### responsePeriod
Response Period: time period in which the keeper promises to respond to an invocation.
There are no penalties for being late within this contract.


```solidity
uint256 public responsePeriod;
```


### baseURI
Base URI for tokenURI JSONs. Initially set in the `constructor` and setable with `setBaseURI()`.


```solidity
string internal baseURI;
```


### fundsOf
Funds tracker, per address. Modified by deposits, withdrawals and settlements. The value is without settlement.
It means effective user funds (withdrawable) would be different for keeper (subtracting
`_owedSinceLastSettlement()`) and beneficiary (adding `_owedSinceLastSettlement()`). If Orb is held by the
creator, funds are not subtracted, as Harberger tax does not apply to the creator.


```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public fundsOf;
```


### keeperTaxNumerator
Harberger tax for holding. Initial value is 10.00%.


```solidity
uint256 public keeperTaxNumerator = 10_00;
```


### royaltyNumerator
Secondary sale royalty paid to beneficiary, based on sale price. Initial value is 10.00%.


```solidity
uint256 public royaltyNumerator = 10_00;
```


### price
Price of the Orb. Also used during auction to store future purchase price. Has no meaning if the Orb is held by
the contract and the auction is not running.


```solidity
uint256 public price;
```


### lastSettlementTime
Last time Orb keeper's funds were settled. Used to calculate amount owed since last settlement. Has no meaning
if the Orb is held by the contract.


```solidity
uint256 public lastSettlementTime;
```


### auctionStartingPrice
Auction starting price. Initial value is 0 - allows any bid.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionStartingPrice;
```


### auctionMinimumBidStep
Auction minimum bid step: required increase between bids. Each bid has to increase over previous bid by at
least this much. If trying to set as zero, will be set to 1 (wei). Initial value is also 1 wei, to disallow
equal value bids.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionMinimumBidStep = 1;
```


### auctionMinimumDuration
Auction minimum duration: the auction will run for at least this long. Initial value is 1 day, and this value
cannot be set to zero, as it would prevent any bids from being made.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionMinimumDuration = 1 days;
```


### auctionKeeperMinimumDuration
Keeper's Auction minimum duration: auction started by the keeper via `relinquishWithAuction()` will run for at
least this long. Initial value is 1 day, and this value cannot be set to zero, as it would prevent any bids
from being made.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionKeeperMinimumDuration = 1 days;
```


### auctionBidExtension
Auction bid extension: if auction remaining time is less than this after a bid is made, auction will continue
for at least this long. Can be set to zero, in which case the auction will always be `auctionMinimumDuration`
long. Initial value is 5 minutes.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionBidExtension = 5 minutes;
```


### auctionEndTime
Auction end time: timestamp when the auction ends, can be extended by late bids. 0 not during the auction.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionEndTime;
```


### leadingBidder
Leading bidder: address that currently has the highest bid. 0 not during the auction and before first bid.


```solidity
address public leadingBidder;
```


### leadingBid
Leading bid: highest current bid. 0 not during the auction and before first bid.


```solidity
uint256 public leadingBid;
```


### auctionBeneficiary
Auction Beneficiary: address that receives most of the auction proceeds. Zero address if run by creator.


```solidity
address public auctionBeneficiary;
```


### cooldown
Cooldown: how often the Orb can be invoked.


```solidity
uint256 public cooldown = 7 days;
```


### flaggingPeriod
Flagging Period: for how long after an invocation the keeper can flag the response.


```solidity
uint256 public flaggingPeriod = 7 days;
```


### cleartextMaximumLength
Maximum length for invocation cleartext content.


```solidity
uint256 public cleartextMaximumLength = 280;
```


### keeperReceiveTime
Keeper receive time: when the Orb was last transferred, except to this contract.


```solidity
uint256 public keeperReceiveTime;
```


### lastInvocationTime
Last invocation time: when the Orb was last invoked. Used together with `cooldown` constant.


```solidity
uint256 public lastInvocationTime;
```


### invocations
Mapping for invocations: invocationId to InvocationData struct. InvocationId starts at 1.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => InvocationData) public invocations;
```


### invocationCount
Count of invocations made: used to calculate invocationId of the next invocation.


```solidity
uint256 public invocationCount;
```


### responses
Mapping for responses (answers to invocations): matching invocationId to ResponseData struct.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => ResponseData) public responses;
```


### responseFlagged
Mapping for flagged (reported) responses. Used by the keeper not satisfied with a response.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public responseFlagged;
```


### flaggedResponsesCount
Flagged responses count is a convencience count of total flagged responses. Not used by the contract itself.


```solidity
uint256 public flaggedResponsesCount;
```


## Functions
### constructor

*When deployed, contract mints the only token that will ever exist, to itself.
This token represents the Orb and is called the Orb elsewhere in the contract.
`Ownable` sets the deployer to be the `owner()`, and also the creator in the Orb context.*


```solidity
constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_, uint256 tokenId_, address beneficiary_, string memory baseURI_)
    ERC721(name_, symbol_);
```
**Parameters**

|`symbol_`|`string`|       Orb symbol or ticker, used in ERC-721 metadata.|
|`tokenId_`|`uint256`|      ERC-721 token id of the Orb.|
|`beneficiary_`|`address`|  Address to receive all Orb proceeds.|
|`baseURI_`|`string`|      Initial baseURI value for tokenURI JSONs.|


### supportsInterface

*ERC-165 supportsInterface. Orb contract supports ERC-721 and IOrb interfaces.*


```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    override(ERC721, ERC165, IERC165)
    returns (bool isInterfaceSupported);
```
**Parameters**

### onlyKeeper

*Ensures that the caller owns the Orb. Should only be used in conjuction with `onlyKeeperHeld` or on
external functions, otherwise does not make sense.
Contract inherits `onlyOwner` modifier from `Ownable`.*

```

### onlyKeeperHeld

*Ensures that the Orb belongs to someone, not the contract itself.*


```solidity
modifier onlyKeeperHeld();
```

### onlyCreatorControlled

*Ensures that the Orb belongs to the contract itself or the creator, and the auction hasn't been started.
Most setting-adjusting functions should use this modifier. It means that the Orb properties cannot be
modified while it is held by the keeper or users can bid on the Orb.*


```solidity
modifier onlyCreatorControlled();
```

### notDuringAuction

*Ensures that an auction is currently not running. Can be multiple states: auction not started, auction
over but not finalized, or auction finalized.*


```solidity
modifier notDuringAuction();
```

### onlyKeeperSolvent

*Ensures that the current Orb keeper has enough funds to cover Harberger tax until now.*


```solidity
modifier onlyKeeperSolvent();
```

### _baseURI

*Override to provide ERC-721 contract's `tokenURI()` with the baseURI.*

*See `transferFrom()`.*


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address, address, uint256, bytes memory) public pure override;
```

### _transferOrb

*Transfers the ERC-721 token to the new address. If the new owner is not this contract (an actual user),
updates `keeperReceiveTime`. `keeperReceiveTime` is used to limit response flagging duration.*

```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`isAuctionRunning`|`bool`| If the auction is running.|


### minimumBid

Minimum bid that would currently be accepted by `bid()`.

*`auctionStartingPrice` if no bids were made, otherwise the leading bid increased by
`auctionMinimumBidStep`.*


```solidity
function minimumBid() public view returns (uint256 auctionMinimumBid);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`auctionMinimumBid`|`uint256`| Minimum bid required for `bid()`.|


### startAuction

Allow the Orb creator to start the Orb auction. Will run for at least `auctionMinimumDuration`.

*Prevents repeated starts by checking the `auctionEndTime`. Important to set `auctionEndTime` to 0
after auction is finalized. Emits `AuctionStart`.*


```solidity
function startAuction() external onlyOwner notDuringAuction;
```

### bid

### finalizeAuction

Finalizes the auction, transferring the winning bid to the beneficiary, and the Orb to the winner.
If the auction was started by previous Keeper with `relinquishWithAuction()`, then most of the auction
proceeds (minus the royalty) will be sent to the previous Keeper. Sets `lastInvocationTime` so that
the Orb could be invoked immediately. The price has been set when bidding, now becomes relevant. If no
bids were made, resets the state to allow the auction to be started again later.

*Critical state transition function. Called after `auctionEndTime`, but only if it's not 0. Can be
called by anyone, although probably will be called by the creator or the winner. Emits `PriceUpdate`
and `AuctionFinalization`.*


```solidity
function finalizeAuction() external notDuringAuction;
```

### deposit

Allows depositing funds on the contract. Not allowed for insolvent keepers.

*Deposits are not allowed for insolvent keepers to prevent cheating via front-running. If the user
becomes insolvent, the Orb will always be returned to the contract as the next step. Emits `Deposit`.*


```solidity
function deposit() external payable;
```

### withdrawAll

Function to withdraw all funds on the contract. Not recommended for current Orb keepers if the price
is not zero, as they will become immediately foreclosable. To give up the Orb, call `relinquish()`.

*Not allowed for the leading auction bidder.*


```solidity
function withdrawAll() external;
```

### withdraw

Function to withdraw given amount from the contract. For current Orb keepers, reduces the time until
foreclosure.

*Not allowed for the leading auction bidder.*


```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`amount`|`uint256`| The amount to withdraw.|


### withdrawAllForBeneficiary

Function to withdraw all beneficiary funds on the contract. Settles if possible.

*Allowed for anyone at any time, does not use `msg.sender` in its execution.*


```solidity
function withdrawAllForBeneficiary() external;
```

### settle

Settlements transfer funds from Orb keeper to the beneficiary. Orb accounting minimizes required
transactions: Orb keeper's foreclosure time is only dependent on the price and available funds. Fund
transfers are not necessary unless these variables (price, keeper funds) are being changed. Settlement
transfers funds owed since the last settlement, and a new period of virtual accounting begins.

*See also `_settle()`.*


```solidity
function settle() external onlyKeeperHeld;
```

### keeperSolvent

*Returns if the current Orb keeper has enough funds to cover Harberger tax until now. Always true if
creator holds the Orb.*


```solidity
function keeperSolvent() public view returns (bool isKeeperSolvent);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`isKeeperSolvent`|`bool`| If the current keeper is solvent.|


### feeDenominator

*Returns the accounting base for Orb fees (Harberger tax rate and royalty).*


```solidity
function feeDenominator() external pure returns (uint256 feeDenominatorValue);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`feeDenominatorValue`|`uint256`| The accounting base for Orb fees.|


### keeperTaxPeriod

*Returns the Harberger tax period base. Keeper tax is for each of this period.*


```solidity
function keeperTaxPeriod() external pure returns (uint256 keeperTaxPeriodSeconds);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`keeperTaxPeriodSeconds`|`uint256`| How long is the Harberger tax period, in seconds.|


### _owedSinceLastSettlement

*Calculates how much money Orb keeper owes Orb beneficiary. This amount would be transferred between
accounts during settlement. **Owed amount can be higher than keeper's funds!** It's important to check
if keeper has enough funds before transferring.*


```solidity
function _owedSinceLastSettlement() internal view returns (uint256 owedValue);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owedValue`|`uint256`| Wei Orb keeper owes Orb beneficiary since the last settlement time.|


### _withdraw

*Executes the withdrawal for a given amount, does the actual value transfer from the contract to user's
wallet. The only function in the contract that sends value and has re-entrancy risk. Does not check if
the address is payable, as the Address library reverts if it is not. Emits `Withdrawal`.*


```solidity
function _withdraw(address recipient_, uint256 amount_) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`recipient_`|`address`| The address to send the value to.|
|`amount_`|`uint256`|    The value in wei to withdraw from the contract.|


### _settle

*Keeper might owe more than they have funds available: it means that the keeper is foreclosable.
Settlement would transfer all keeper funds to the beneficiary, but not more. Does not transfer funds if
the creator holds the Orb, but always updates `lastSettlementTime`. Should never be called if Orb is
owned by the contract. Emits `Settlement`.*


```solidity
function _settle() internal;
```

### setPrice

Sets the new purchase price for the Orb. Harberger tax means the asset is always for sale. The price
can be set to zero, making foreclosure time to be never. Can only be called by a solvent keeper.
Settles before adjusting the price, as the new price will change foreclosure time.

*Emits `Settlement` and `PriceUpdate`. See also `_setPrice()`.*


```solidity
function setPrice(uint256 newPrice) external onlyKeeper onlyKeeperSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPrice`|`uint256`| New price for the Orb.|


### listWithPrice

Lists the Orb for sale at the given price to buy directly from the Orb creator. This is an alternative
to the auction mechanism, and can be used to simply have the Orb for sale at a fixed price, waiting
for the buyer. Listing is only allowed if the auction has not been started and the Orb is held by the
contract. When the Orb is purchased from the creator, all proceeds go to the beneficiary and the Orb
comes fully charged, with no cooldown.

*Emits `Transfer` and `PriceUpdate`.*


```solidity
function listWithPrice(uint256 listingPrice) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`listingPrice`|`uint256`| The price to buy the Orb from the creator.|


### purchase

Purchasing is the mechanism to take over the Orb. With Harberger tax, the Orb can always be purchased
from its keeper. Purchasing is only allowed while the keeper is solvent. If not, the Orb has to be
foreclosed and re-auctioned. This function does not require the purchaser to have more funds than
required, but purchasing without any reserve would leave the new owner immediately foreclosable.
Beneficiary receives either just the royalty, or full price if the Orb is purchased from the creator.

*Requires to provide key Orb parameters (current price, Harberger tax rate, royalty, cooldown and
cleartext maximum length) to prevent front-running: without these parameters Orb creator could
front-run purcaser and change Orb parameters before the purchase; and without current price anyone
could purchase the Orb ahead of the purchaser, set the price higher, and profit from the purchase.
Does not modify `lastInvocationTime` unless buying from the creator.
Does not allow settlement in the same block before `purchase()` to prevent transfers that avoid
royalty payments. Does not allow purchasing from yourself. Emits `PriceUpdate` and `Purchase`.*


```solidity
function purchase(
    uint256 newPrice,
    uint256 currentPrice,
    uint256 currentKeeperTaxNumerator,
    uint256 currentRoyaltyNumerator,
    uint256 currentCooldown,
    uint256 currentCleartextMaximumLength
) external payable onlyKeeperHeld onlyKeeperSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPrice`|`uint256`|                      New price to use after the purchase.|
|`currentPrice`|`uint256`|                  Current price, to prevent front-running.|
|`currentKeeperTaxNumerator`|`uint256`|     Current keeper tax numerator, to prevent front-running.|
|`currentRoyaltyNumerator`|`uint256`|       Current royalty numerator, to prevent front-running.|
|`currentCooldown`|`uint256`|               Current cooldown, to prevent front-running.|
|`currentCleartextMaximumLength`|`uint256`| Current cleartext maximum length, to prevent front-running.|


### _splitProceeds

*Assigns proceeds to beneficiary and primary receiver, accounting for royalty. Used by `purchase()` and
`finalizeAuction()`. Fund deducation should happen before calling this function. Receiver might be
beneficiary if no split is needed.
MAXIMUM_PRICE to prevent potential overflows in math. Emits `PriceUpdate`.*


```solidity
function _splitProceeds(uint256 proceeds_, address receiver_) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`proceeds_`|`uint256`| Total proceeds to split between beneficiary and receiver.|
|`receiver_`|`address`| Address of the receiver of the proceeds minus royalty.|


### _setPrice

*Does not check if the new price differs from the previous price: no risk. Limits the price to
MAXIMUM_PRICE to prevent potential overflows in math. Emits `PriceUpdate`.*


```solidity
function _setPrice(uint256 newPrice_) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPrice_`|`uint256`| New price for the Orb.|


### relinquish

Relinquishment is a voluntary giving up of the Orb. It's a combination of withdrawing all funds not
owed to the beneficiary since last settlement and transferring the Orb to the contract. Keepers giving
up the Orb may start an auction for it for their own benefit. Once auction is finalized, most of the
proceeds (minus the royalty) go to the relinquishing Keeper. Alternatives to relinquisment are setting
the price to zero or withdrawing all funds. Orb creator cannot start the keeper auction via this
function, and must call `relinquish(false)` and `startAuction()` separately to run the creator
auction.

*Calls `_withdraw()`, which does value transfer from the contract. Emits `Relinquishment`,
`Withdrawal`, and optionally `AuctionStart`.*


```solidity
function relinquish(bool withAuction) external onlyKeeper onlyKeeperSolvent;
```

### foreclose

Foreclose can be called by anyone after the Orb keeper runs out of funds to cover the Harberger tax.
It returns the Orb to the contract, readying it for re-auction.

*Emits `Foreclosure`.*


```solidity
function foreclose() external onlyKeeperHeld;
```

### invokeWithCleartext

Invokes the Orb. Allows the keeper to submit cleartext.

*Cleartext is hashed and passed to `invokeWithHash()`. Emits `CleartextRecording`.*


```solidity
function invokeWithCleartext(string memory cleartext) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`cleartext`|`string`| Invocation cleartext.|


### invokeWithHash

Invokes the Orb. Allows the keeper to submit content hash, that represents a question to the Orb
creator. Puts the Orb on cooldown. The Orb can only be invoked by solvent keepers.

*Content hash is keccak256 of the cleartext. `invocationCount` is used to track the id of the next
invocation. Invocation ids start from 1. Emits `Invocation`.*


```solidity
function invokeWithHash(bytes32 contentHash) public onlyKeeper onlyKeeperHeld onlyKeeperSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`contentHash`|`bytes32`| Required keccak256 hash of the cleartext.|


### respond

The Orb creator can use this function to respond to any existing invocation, no matter how long ago
it was made. A response to an invocation can only be written once. There is no way to record response
cleartext on-chain.

*Emits `Response`.*


```solidity
function respond(uint256 invocationId, bytes32 contentHash) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId`|`uint256`| Id of an invocation to which the response is being made.|
|`contentHash`|`bytes32`|  keccak256 hash of the response text.|


### flagResponse

Orb keeper can flag a response during Response Flagging Period, counting from when the response is
made. Flag indicates a "report", that the Orb keeper was not satisfied with the response provided.
This is meant to act as a social signal to future Orb keepers. It also increments
`flaggedResponsesCount`, allowing anyone to quickly look up how many responses were flagged.

*Only existing responses (with non-zero timestamps) can be flagged. Responses can only be flagged by
solvent keepers to keep it consistent with `invokeWithHash()` or `invokeWithCleartext()`. Also, the
keeper must have received the Orb after the response was made; this is to prevent keepers from
flagging responses that were made in response to others' invocations. Emits `ResponseFlagging`.*


```solidity
function flagResponse(uint256 invocationId) external onlyKeeper onlyKeeperSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId`|`uint256`| Id of an invocation to which the response is being flagged.|


### _responseExists

*Returns if a response to an invocation exists, based on the timestamp of the response being non-zero.*


```solidity
function _responseExists(uint256 invocationId_) internal view returns (bool isResponseFound);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId_`|`uint256`| Id of an invocation to which to check the existance of a response of.|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`isResponseFound`|`bool`| If a response to an invocation exists or not.|


## Structs
### InvocationData
Structs used to track invocation and response information: keccak256 content hash and block timestamp.
InvocationData is used to determine if the response can be flagged by the keeper.
Invocation timestamp is tracked for the benefit of other contracts.


```solidity
struct InvocationData {
    address invoker;
    bytes32 contentHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
```

### ResponseData

```solidity
struct ResponseData {
    bytes32 contentHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
```
