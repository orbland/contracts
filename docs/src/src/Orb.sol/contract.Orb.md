This is a basic Q&A-type Orb. The holder has the right to submit a text-based question to the creator and
the right to receive a text-based response. The question is limited in length but responses may come in
any length. Questions and answers are hash-committed to the blockchain so that the track record cannot be
changed. The Orb has a cooldown.
The Orb uses Harberger tax and is always on sale. This means that when you purchase the Orb, you must also
set a price which youâ€™re willing to sell the Orb at. However, you must pay an amount based on tax rate to
the Orb contract per year in order to maintain the Orb ownership. This amount is accounted for per second,
and user funds need to be topped up before the foreclosure time to maintain ownership.

*Supports ERC-721 interface but reverts on all transfers. Uses `Ownable`'s `owner()` to identify the
creator of the Orb. Uses `ERC721`'s `ownerOf(tokenId)` to identify the current holder of the Orb.*


## State Variables
### beneficiary
Beneficiary is another address that receives all Orb proceeds. It is set in the `constructor` as an immutable
value. Beneficiary is not allowed to bid in the auction or purchase the Orb. The intended use case for the
beneficiary is to set it to a revenue splitting contract. Proceeds that go to the beneficiary are:
- The auction winning bid amount;
- Royalties from Orb purchase when not purchased from the Orb creator;
- Full purchase price when purchased from the Orb creator;
- Harberger tax revenue.


```solidity
address public immutable beneficiary;
```


### tokenId
Orb ERC-721 token number. Can be whatever arbitrary number, only one token will ever exist. Made public to
allow easier lookups of Orb holder.


```solidity
uint256 public immutable tokenId;
```


### FEE_DENOMINATOR
Fee Nominator: basis points. Other fees are in relation to this.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10_000;
```


### HOLDER_TAX_PERIOD
Harberger tax period: for how long the tax rate applies. Value: 1 year.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant HOLDER_TAX_PERIOD = 365 days;
```


### COOLDOWN_MAXIMUM_DURATION
Maximum cooldown duration, to prevent potential underflows. Value: 10 years.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant COOLDOWN_MAXIMUM_DURATION = 3650 days;
```


### MAX_PRICE
Maximum Orb price, limited to prevent potential overflows.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant MAX_PRICE = 2 ** 128;
```


### honoredUntil
Honored Until: timestamp until which the Orb Oath is honored for the holder.


```solidity
uint256 public honoredUntil;
```


### baseURI
Base URI for tokenURI JSONs. Initially set in the `constructor` and setable with `setBaseURI()`.


```solidity
string internal baseURI;
```


### fundsOf
Funds tracker, per address. Modified by deposits, withdrawals and settlements. The value is without settlement.
It means effective user funds (withdrawable) would be different for holder (subtracting
`_owedSinceLastSettlement()`) and beneficiary (adding `_owedSinceLastSettlement()`). If Orb is held by the
creator, funds are not subtracted, as Harberger tax does not apply to the creator.


```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public fundsOf;
```


### holderTaxNumerator
Harberger tax for holding. Initial value is 10%.


```solidity
uint256 public holderTaxNumerator = 1_000;
```


### royaltyNumerator
Secondary sale royalty paid to beneficiary, based on sale price.


```solidity
uint256 public royaltyNumerator = 1_000;
```


### price
Price of the Orb. No need for mapping, as only one token is ever minted. Also used during auction to store
future purchase price. Has no meaning if the Orb is held by the contract and the auction is not running.


```solidity
uint256 public price;
```


### lastSettlementTime
Last time Orb holder's funds were settled. Used to calculate amount owed since last settlement. Has no meaning
if the Orb is held by the contract.


```solidity
uint256 public lastSettlementTime;
```


### auctionStartingPrice
Auction starting price. Initial value is 0 - allows any bid.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionStartingPrice = 0;
```


### auctionMinimumBidStep
Auction minimum bid step: required increase between bids. Each bid has to increase over previous bid by at
least this much. If trying to set as zero, will be set to 1 (wei). Initial value is also 1 wei, to disallow
equal value bids.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionMinimumBidStep = 1;
```


### auctionMinimumDuration
Auction minimum duration: the auction will run for at least this long. Initial value is 1 day, and this value
cannot be set to zero.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionMinimumDuration = 1 days;
```


### auctionBidExtension
Auction bid extension: if auction remaining time is less than this after a bid is made, auction will continue
for at least this long. Can be set to zero, in which case the auction will always be `auctionMinimumDuration`
long. Initial value is 5 minutes.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionBidExtension = 5 minutes;
```


### auctionEndTime
Auction end time: timestamp when the auction ends, can be extended by late bids. 0 not during the auction.


```solidity
uint256 public auctionEndTime;
```


### leadingBidder
Leading bidder: address that currently has the highest bid. 0 not during the auction and before first bid.


```solidity
address public leadingBidder;
```


### leadingBid
Leading bid: highest current bid. 0 not during the auction and before first bid.


```solidity
uint256 public leadingBid;
```


### cooldown
Cooldown: how often the Orb can be invoked.


```solidity
uint256 public cooldown = 7 days;
```


### cleartextMaximumLength
Maximum length for invocation cleartext content.


```solidity
uint256 public cleartextMaximumLength = 280;
```


### holderReceiveTime
Holder receive time: when the Orb was last transferred, except to this contract.


```solidity
uint256 public holderReceiveTime;
```


### lastInvocationTime
Last invocation time: when the Orb was last invoked. Used together with `cooldown` constant.


```solidity
uint256 public lastInvocationTime;
```


### invocations
Mapping for invocations: invocationId to HashTime struct.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => HashTime) public invocations;
```


### invocationCount
Count of invocations made: used to calculate invocationId of the next invocation.


```solidity
uint256 public invocationCount = 0;
```


### responses
Mapping for responses (answers to invocations): matching invocationId to HashTime struct.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => HashTime) public responses;
```


### responseFlagged
Mapping for flagged (reported) responses. Used by the holder not satisfied with a response.


```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public responseFlagged;
```


### flaggedResponsesCount
Flagged responses count is a convencience count of total flagged responses. Not used by the contract itself.


```solidity
uint256 public flaggedResponsesCount = 0;
```


## Functions
### constructor

*When deployed, contract mints the only token that will ever exist, to itself.
This token represents the Orb and is called the Orb elsewhere in the contract.
`Ownable` sets the deployer to be the `owner()`, and also the creator in the Orb context.*


```solidity
constructor(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    address beneficiary_,
    bytes32 oathHash_,
    uint256 honoredUntil_,
    string memory baseURI_
) ERC721(name_, symbol_);

```

### onlyHolderHeld

*Ensures that the Orb belongs to someone, not the contract itself.*


```solidity
modifier onlyHolderHeld();
```

### onlyCreatorControlled

should use this modifier. It means that the Orb properties cannot be modified while it is held by the
holder.*


```solidity
modifier onlyCreatorControlled();
```

### notDuringAuction

*Ensures that an auction is currently not running. Can be multiple states: auction not started, auction
over but not finalized, or auction finalized.*

modifier notDuringAuction();
```

### onlyHolderSolvent

*Ensures that the current Orb holder has enough funds to cover Harberger tax until now.*


```solidity
modifier onlyHolderSolvent();
```

### swearOath

Allows re-swearing of the Orb Oath and set a new `honoredUntil` date. This function can only be called
by the Orb creator when the Orb is not held by anyone. With `swearOath()`, `honoredUntil` date can be
decreased, unlike with the `extendHonoredUntil()` function.

```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`isAuctionRunning`|`bool`| If the auction is running.|


### minimumBid

```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`auctionMinimumBid`|`uint256`| Minimum bid required for `bid()`.|


### startAuction

Allow the Orb creator to start the Orb auction. Will run for at least `auctionMinimumDuration`.

*Prevents repeated starts by checking the `auctionEndTime`. Important to set `auctionEndTime` to 0
after auction is finalized. Emits `AuctionStart`.*


```solidity
function startAuction() external onlyOwner notDuringAuction;
```

### bid

Bids the provided amount, if there's enough funds across funds on contract and transaction value.
Might extend the auction if bidding close to auction end. Important: the leading bidder will not be
able to withdraw funds until someone outbids them.

*Emits `AuctionBid`.*


```solidity
function bid(uint256 amount, uint256 priceIfWon) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|----|----|-----------|
|`amount`|`uint256`|     The value to bid.|
|`priceIfWon`|`uint256`| Price if the bid wins. Must be less than `MAX_PRICE`.|


### finalizeAuction

Finalizes the auction, transferring the winning bid to the beneficiary, and the Orb to the winner.
Sets `lastInvocationTime` so that the Orb could be invoked immediately. The price has been set when
bidding, now becomes relevant. If no bids were made, resets the state to allow the auction to be
started again later.

*Critical state transition function. Called after `auctionEndTime`, but only if it's not 0. Can be
called by anyone, although probably will be called by the creator or the winner. Emits `PriceUpdate`
and `AuctionFinalization`.*


```solidity
function finalizeAuction() external notDuringAuction;
```

### deposit

Allows depositing funds on the contract. Not allowed for insolvent holders.

*Deposits are not allowed for insolvent holders to prevent cheating via front-running. If the user
becomes insolvent, the Orb will always be returned to the contract as the next step. Emits `Deposit`.*


```solidity
function deposit() external payable;
```

### withdrawAll

Function to withdraw all funds on the contract. Not recommended for current Orb holders, they should
call `relinquish()` to take out their funds.

*Not allowed for the leading auction bidder.*


```solidity
function withdrawAll() external;
```

### withdraw

Function to withdraw given amount from the contract. For current Orb holders, reduces the time until
foreclosure.

*Not allowed for the leading auction bidder.*


```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`amount`|`uint256`| The amount to withdraw.|


### withdrawAllForBeneficiary

Function to withdraw all beneficiary funds on the contract.

*Allowed for anyone at any time, does not use `msg.sender` in its execution.*


```solidity
function withdrawAllForBeneficiary() external;
```

### settle

Settlements transfer funds from Orb holder to the beneficiary. Orb accounting minimizes required
transactions: Orb holder's foreclosure time is only dependent on the price and available funds. Fund
transfers are not necessary unless these variables (price, holder funds) are being changed. Settlement
transfers funds owed since the last settlement, and a new period of virtual accounting begins.

*See also `_settle()`.*


```solidity
function settle() external onlyHolderHeld;
```

### holderSolvent

*Returns if the current Orb holder has enough funds to cover Harberger tax until now. Always true if
creator holds the Orb.*


```solidity
function holderSolvent() public view returns (bool isHolderSolvent);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`isHolderSolvent`|`bool`| If the current holder is solvent.|


### feeDenominator

*Returns the accounting base for Orb fees (Harberger tax rate and royalty).*


```solidity
function feeDenominator() external pure returns (uint256 feeDenominatorValue);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`feeDenominatorValue`|`uint256`| The accounting base for Orb fees.|


### holderTaxPeriod

*Returns the Harberger tax period base. Holder tax is for each of this period.*


```solidity
function holderTaxPeriod() external pure returns (uint256 holderTaxPeriodSeconds);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`holderTaxPeriodSeconds`|`uint256`| How long is the Harberger tax period, in seconds.|


### _owedSinceLastSettlement

*Calculates how much money Orb holder owes Orb beneficiary. This amount would be transferred between
accounts during settlement. **Owed amount can be higher than hodler's funds!** It's important to check
if holder has enough funds before transferring.*


```solidity
function _owedSinceLastSettlement() internal view returns (uint256 owedValue);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owedValue`|`uint256`| Wei Orb holder owes Orb beneficiary since the last settlement time.|


### _withdraw

*Executes the withdrawal for a given amount, does the actual value transfer from the contract to user's
wallet. The only function in the contract that sends value and has re-entrancy risk. Does not check if
the address is payable, as the Address library reverts if it is not. Emits `Withdrawal`.*


```solidity
function _withdraw(address recipient_, uint256 amount_) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`recipient_`|`address`| The address to send the value to.|
|`amount_`|`uint256`|    The value in wei to withdraw from the contract.|


### _settle

*Holder might owe more than they have funds available: it means that the holder is foreclosable.
Settlement would transfer all holder funds to the beneficiary, but not more. Does nothing if the
creator holds the Orb. Reverts if contract holds the Orb. Emits `Settlement`.*


```solidity
function _settle() internal;
```

### setPrice

Sets the new purchase price for the Orb. Harberger tax means the asset is always for sale.
The price can be set to zero, making foreclosure time to be never.

*See also `_setPrice()`.*


```solidity
function setPrice(uint256 newPrice) external onlyHolder onlyHolderSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPrice`|`uint256`| New price for the Orb.|


### listWithPrice

Lists the Orb for sale at the given price to buy directly from the Orb creator. This is an alternative
to the auction mechanism, and can be used to simply have the Orb for sale at a fixed price, waiting
for the buyer. Listing is only allowed if the auction has not been started and the Orb is held by the
contract. When the Orb is purchased from the creator, all proceeds go to the beneficiary and the Orb
comes fully charged, with no cooldown.

*Emits `Transfer` and `PriceUpdate`.*


```solidity
function listWithPrice(uint256 listingPrice) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`listingPrice`|`uint256`| The price to buy the Orb from the creator.|


### purchase

Purchasing is the mechanism to take over the Orb. With Harberger tax, the Orb can always be purchased
from its holder. Purchasing is only allowed while the holder is solvent. If not, the Orb has to be
foreclosed and re-auctioned. Purchaser is required to have more funds than the price itself, but the
exact amount is left for the user interface implementation to calculate and send along. Purchasing
sends royalty part to the beneficiary.

*Requires to provide the current price as the first parameter to prevent front-running: without current
price requirement someone could purchase the Orb ahead of someone else, set the price higher, and
profit from the purchase. Does not modify `lastInvocationTime` unless buying from the creator.
Does not allow purchasing from yourself. Emits `PriceUpdate` and `Purchase`.*


```solidity
function purchase(uint256 currentPrice, uint256 newPrice) external payable onlyHolderHeld onlyHolderSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`currentPrice`|`uint256`| Current price, to prevent front-running.|
|`newPrice`|`uint256`|     New price to use after the purchase.|


### _setPrice

*Can only be called by a solvent holder. Settles before adjusting the price, as the new price will
change foreclosure time. Does not check if the new price differs from the previous price: no risk.
Limits the price to MAX_PRICE to prevent potential overflows in math. Emits `PriceUpdate`.*


```solidity
function _setPrice(uint256 newPrice_) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPrice_`|`uint256`| New price for the Orb.|


### relinquish

Relinquishment is a voluntary giving up of the Orb. It's a combination of withdrawing all funds not
owed to the beneficiary since last settlement, and foreclosing yourself after. Most useful if the
creator themselves hold the Orb and want to re-auction it. For any other holder, setting the price to
zero would be more practical.

*Calls `_withdraw()`, which does value transfer from the contract. Emits `Foreclosure` and
`Withdrawal`.*


```solidity
function relinquish() external onlyHolder onlyHolderSolvent;
```

### foreclose

Foreclose can be called by anyone after the Orb holder runs out of funds to cover the Harberger tax.
It returns the Orb to the contract, readying it for re-auction.

*Emits `Foreclosure`.*


```solidity
function foreclose() external onlyHolderHeld;
```

### invokeWithCleartext

Invokes the Orb. Allows the holder to submit cleartext.

*Cleartext is hashed and passed to `invokeWithHash()`. Emits `CleartextRecording`.*


```solidity
function invokeWithCleartext(string memory cleartext) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`cleartext`|`string`| Invocation cleartext.|


### invokeWithHash

Invokes the Orb. Allows the holder to submit content hash, that represents a question to the Orb
creator. Puts the Orb on cooldown. The Orb can only be invoked by solvent holders.

*Content hash is keccak256 of the cleartext. `invocationCount` is used to track the id of the next
invocation. Invocation ids start from 1. Emits `Invocation`.*


```solidity
function invokeWithHash(bytes32 contentHash) public onlyHolder onlyHolderHeld onlyHolderSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`contentHash`|`bytes32`| Required keccak256 hash of the cleartext.|


### recordInvocationCleartext

Function allows the holder to reveal cleartext later, either because it was challenged by the creator,
or just for posterity. Only invocations from current holder can have their cleartext recorded.

*Only holders can reveal cleartext on-chain. Anyone could potentially figure out the invocation
cleartext from the content hash via brute force, but publishing this on-chain is only allowed by the
holder themselves, introducing a reasonable privacy protection. If the content hash is of a cleartext
that is longer than maximum cleartext length, the contract will never record this cleartext, as it is
invalid. Allows overwriting. Assuming no hash collisions, this poses no risk, just wastes holder gas.
Emits `CleartextRecording`.*


```solidity
function recordInvocationCleartext(uint256 invocationId, string memory cleartext)
    external
    onlyHolder
    onlyHolderSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId`|`uint256`| Invocation id, matching the one that was emitted when calling `invokeWithCleartext()` or `invokeWithHash()`.|
|`cleartext`|`string`|    Cleartext, limited in length. Must match the content hash.|


### respond

The Orb creator can use this function to respond to any existing invocation, no matter how long ago
it was made. A response to an invocation can only be written once. There is no way to record response
cleartext on-chain.

*Emits `Response`.*


```solidity
function respond(uint256 invocationId, bytes32 contentHash) external onlyOwner;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId`|`uint256`| Id of an invocation to which the response is being made.|
|`contentHash`|`bytes32`|  keccak256 hash of the response text.|


### flagResponse

Orb holder can flag a response during Response Flagging Period, counting from when the response is
made. Flag indicates a "report", that the Orb holder was not satisfied with the response provided.
This is meant to act as a social signal to future Orb holders. It also increments
`flaggedResponsesCount`, allowing anyone to quickly look up how many responses were flagged.

*Only existing responses (with non-zero timestamps) can be flagged. Responses can only be flagged by
solvent holders to keep it consistent with `invokeWithHash()` or `invokeWithCleartext()`. Also, the
holder must have received the Orb after the response was made; this is to prevent holders from
flagging responses that were made in response to others' invocations. Emits `ResponseFlagging`.*


```solidity
function flagResponse(uint256 invocationId) external onlyHolder onlyHolderSolvent;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId`|`uint256`| ID of an invocation to which the response is being flagged.|


### _responseExists

*Returns if a response to an invocation exists, based on the timestamp of the response being non-zero.*

function _responseExists(uint256 invocationId_) internal view returns (bool isResponseFound);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`invocationId_`|`uint256`| ID of an invocation to which to check the existance of a response of.|

## Structs
### HashTime
Struct used to track invocation and response information: keccak256 content hash and block timestamp.
When used for responses, timestamp is used to determine if the response can be flagged by the holder.
Invocation timestamp is tracked for the benefit of other contracts.


```solidity
struct HashTime {
    bytes32 contentHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
```
