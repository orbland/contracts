# ðŸ”® Orb Contract â€¢ [![test](https://github.com/orbland/orb/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orbland/orb/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg?label=license)

Auction + Harberger taxed ownership. Used by [orb.land](https://orb.land). Uses Forge toolkit for building and testing. Contract combines the following areas of functionality:

- **Auction.** Allows the contract owner to start the Orb auction, determining the first owner of the Orb.
- **Funds management.** Allows any user to deposit and withdraw funds. Funds are used to make auction bids and pay Harberger Tax.
- **Harberger Tax.** Uses delayed accounting (settling) to allocate funds from the current owner to the contract beneficiary, based on the price set by the owner and tax rate.
- **On-chain Orb Invocations.** Called triggers and responses, they allow the owner to periodically invoke the Orb, requesting a response from the Orb creator.
- **ERC-721 compatibility.** All transfers revert, but otherwise the contract appears as supporting all ERC-721 functions.

The contract is fully documented in NatSpec format.
