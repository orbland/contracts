/**
 * @title   Eric's Orb - Harberger Tax NFT with auction and on-chain triggers and responses
 * @author  Jonas Lekevicius, Eric Wall
 * @dev     Supports ERC-721 interface, does not support token transfers.
 *          Uses {Ownable}'s {owner()} to identify the issuer of the Orb.
 * @notice  Eric's Orb is a basic Q&A-type Orb. The holder has the right to submit a text-based question to
 *          Eric and the right to receive a text-based response. The question is limited to 280 characters but
 *          responses may come in any length. Questions and answers are hash-committed to the Ethereum blockchain
 *          so that the track record cannot be changed. The Orb has a 1-week cooldown.
 *
 *          The Orb uses Harberger Tax and is always on sale. This means that when you purchase the Orb, you must
 *          also set a price which youâ€™re willing to sell the Orb at. However, you must pay 10% of that amount to
 *          the Orb smart contract per year in order to maintain the Orb ownership. This amount is accounted for
 *          per second, and user funds need to be topped up before the foreclosure time to maintain ownership.
