/// @notice  The Orb is issued by a Creator: the user who swore an Orb Oath together with a date until which the Oath
///          will be honored. The Creator can list the Orb for sale at a fixed price, or run an auction for it. The user
///          acquiring the Orb is known as the Keeper. The Keeper always has an Orb sale price set and is paying
///          Harberger tax based on their set price and a tax rate set by the Creator. This tax is accounted for per
///          second, and the Keeper must have enough funds on this contract to cover their ownership; otherwise the Orb
///          is re-auctioned, delivering most of the auction proceeds to the previous Keeper. The Orb also has a
///          cooldown that allows the Keeper to invoke the Orb â€” ask the Creator a question and receive their response,
///          based on conditions set in the Orb Oath. Invocation and response hashes and timestamps are tracked in an
///          Orb Invocation Registry.
