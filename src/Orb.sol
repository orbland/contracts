/// @notice  This is a basic Q&A-type Orb. The keeper has the right to submit a text-based question to the creator and
///          the right to receive a text-based response. The question is limited in length but responses may come in
///          any length. Questions and answers are hash-committed to the blockchain so that the track record cannot be
///          changed. The Orb has a cooldown.
///          The Orb uses Harberger tax and is always on sale. This means that when you purchase the Orb, you must also
///          set a price which youâ€™re willing to sell the Orb at. However, you must pay an amount based on tax rate to
///          the Orb contract per year in order to maintain the Orb ownership. This amount is accounted for per second,
///          and user funds need to be topped up before the foreclosure time to maintain ownership.
/// @dev     Supports ERC-721 interface but reverts on all transfers. Uses `Ownable`'s `owner()` to identify the
///          creator of the Orb. Uses `ERC721`'s `ownerOf(tokenId)` to identify the current keeper of the Orb.
